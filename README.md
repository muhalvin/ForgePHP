# ForgePHP

ForgePHP is a lightweight, native PHP framework built to deliver a modern development experience — ideal for small or personal projects that value simplicity, structure, and freedom from heavy dependencies.

This is a minimal framework I use for small-scale or personal projects where I don't need a lot of dependencies — just something simple, fast, and easy to work with.
